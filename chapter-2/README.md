# Setting VUE environment

1. We can instal VUE cli (local or globally).

`npm install -g @vue/cli`

2. To create the "hello-project" project, type:

`vue create hello-project`

3. Options to run:

`npm run serve`: Will start the server, process the files in src directory and recompile on any change

`npm run build`: build the project and crate an optimized production app.

`npm run lint`: Apply the linter in the lintConfig section of the package.json.
